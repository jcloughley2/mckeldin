  <p>NONUMENT is an international initiative that seeks to redefine the role of monuments today, especially hidden urban spaces in transition that carry physical and mental symbolic value for the public using the spaces. In cities throughout the world public spaces are becoming more regulated, more commercial and less public. McKeldin Square is a free speech zone in Baltimore’s Inner Harbor and is in danger of loosing it’s free status. As an vcentral urban commercial-free site, it’s popular among tourists, workers and residents. NONUMENT01:The McKeldin Fountain will create a virtual memorial to the brutalist architectural that’s currently being demolished.</p>

  <p>An augmented reality APP will replace the Fountain with a 3D model, video, animations, stories and historical information. Viewers will hold up a smartphone or tablet in order to see and hear nearly forgotten stories from the site including first-hand stories from Occupy Baltimore, the Black Lives Matter movement and protests in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray in the hands of Baltimore Police, activist groups such as Women in Black, comedians, marriage proposals, soap bubbles, mermaid performances and many others personal, poetic and political stories generated from this free speech zone in danger of loosing it’s free status.
